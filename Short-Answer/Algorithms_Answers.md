#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This example is an 0(n). The code will only run once time no matter the size of n is and will repeat once the loop starts. As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate.

b)There is a nested loop so O(n^2). I read in the Big O examples that O(n^2) represents an algorithm thats performance is exactly proportional to the square of the size of the input data.


c)This example is 0(n) due to the fact that recursion is being used and will run until the end. As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate.
